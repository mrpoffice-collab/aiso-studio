# Content Scoring Scale - Recalibrated for Honesty

## Philosophy
Our scoring system is calibrated to be **honest and achievable**. A score of 100 is rare but possible, not impossible. We don't use grade inflation - we use real-world benchmarks.

## Target Scores

### For Content Rewrites

- **Iterations**: Usually achievable in 2-3 attempts (~$0.20-$0.30)

### For Manual Review

- **80-89**: Ready to publish with minor tweaks
- **70-79**: Needs rewrite or significant editing
- **Below 70**: Major rewrite required

## Comparison to Old Scale

### Old Scale (Broken)
- 70 = "Good" (but felt average)
- 85 = "Excellent" (but felt like minimum)
- 95-100 = Impossible to achieve

### New Scale (Honest)
- 70 = "Fair" (needs improvement)
- 80 = "Good" (professional quality)
- 90 = "Excellent" (top-tier)
- 95-100 = Outstanding (rare but achievable)

## Why This Scale is Better

1. **Honest**: A 70 now accurately reflects "fair but needs work"
2. **Achievable**: A 90+ is rare but possible with effort
3. **Motivating**: Clear targets that are worth pursuing
4. **Industry-aligned**: Matches real-world content quality expectations
5. **Defensible**: We can explain exactly why content scored what it did

## Using the Scale

"Your content scored 82 - that's Good professional quality. To reach Excellent (90+), we'd need to..."

### For Internal Teams
