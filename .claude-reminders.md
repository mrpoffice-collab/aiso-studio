# Project Reminders for Claude

## CRITICAL INFORMATION

### Environment
- **ALWAYS assume PRODUCTION unless user says otherwise**
- Production URL: [Add your Vercel URL here]
- Local dev runs on: http://localhost:3001 (port 3000 usually taken)

### Database
- Using Neon PostgreSQL (production)
- Connection string in .env.local
- user_id fields are UUID (not INTEGER)

### Key Decisions Made
- **Freedom-first pricing**: UNLIMITED AI searchability/diagnostics, LIMITED operational capacity
- **Agency marketplace**: 15-25% referral fee on closed deals
- **Value proposition**: "Find clients invisible to AI search. Fix it. Charge $5K-$10K"

### Recent Major Changes
- ✅ Phase 1: AI searchability messaging and pricing restructure
- ✅ Phase 2: Technical SEO diagnostics + agency marketplace (3 new tables)
- ⚠️ Current issue: Production sign-in not working after deployment

### Backup Strategy
- All code in git (github.com/mrpoffice-collab/aiso-studio)
- Database: Neon PostgreSQL (need to set up automated backups)
- Always commit before major changes

### Safety Checklist Before Major Changes
1. [ ] Create new git branch
2. [ ] Export database backup
3. [ ] Test on local first
4. [ ] Deploy to Vercel preview first
5. [ ] Verify in production
