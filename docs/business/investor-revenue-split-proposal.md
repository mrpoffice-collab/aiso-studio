- % share of **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** (shared with investor)

### You Contribute:
- 100% of product development and engineering
- 100% of technical infrastructure and maintenance

## Economic Modeling

### Scenario: 100 Agency Subscribers in Year 1

**Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):**
- 60 agencies at $299/month = $17,940
- 30 agencies at $599/month = $17,970
- 10 agencies at $1,299/month = $12,990
- **Total MRR: $48,900/month**
- **Annual MRR: $586,800**

**Referral Fee Revenue (Your Lead Generation):**
- 100 agencies × 2 leads/month average = 200 leads/month
- 20% close rate = 40 closed deals/month
- Average deal value: $10,000
- Your 20% referral fee: $2,000/deal
- **Total referral revenue: $80,000/month**
- **Annual referral revenue: $960,000**

### If MRR Split 50/50 with Investor:

**Your Annual Income:**
- MRR share (50%): $293,400
- Referral fees (100%): $960,000
- **Total: $1,253,400**

**Investor's Annual Income:**
- MRR share (50%): $293,400
- Referral fees: $0
- **Total: $293,400**

**Income Ratio:** You earn 4.3x what investor earns

## Fairness Analysis

### This Structure is FAIR if:

✅ Investor contributed significant capital ($50,000 - $100,000+)
✅ Investor actively refers agencies and drives subscriptions
✅ MRR split reflects actual equity ownership (e.g., they own 50% of company)
✅ Investor provides ongoing strategic value beyond just feedback
✅ You're compensated separately for operational work (salary or additional equity)

### This Structure is TOO GENEROUS to Investor if:

❌ Investor contributed minimal capital (<$25,000)
❌ Investor is mostly passive (just using app + occasional feedback)
❌ You're doing 95%+ of the work (building, running, lead gen)
❌ Investor's MRR share is higher than their equity ownership
❌ No adjustment mechanism as your contribution compounds over time

---

## Alternative Structure Options

### Option A: Revenue Split by Source

**MRR Distribution:**
- Agencies YOU refer → You: 80%, Investor: 20%
- Agencies THEY refer → They: 80%, You: 20%
- Organic signups → Split 50/50

**Referral Fees:**
- You keep 100% from leads you generate
- They keep 100% from leads they generate

**Why This Works:**
- Rewards whoever does the work
- Incentivizes both parties to actively sell
- More directly aligned with value contribution

---

### Option B: Tiered Profit Share (Scales with Growth)

**Tier 1: Up to $500K ARR**
- MRR split: 50/50 (acknowledges investor's early-stage help)
- Referral fees: You keep 100%

**Tier 2: $500K - $2M ARR**
- MRR split: 70/30 (your favor - you're scaling the business)
- Referral fees: You keep 100%

**Tier 3: Above $2M ARR**
- MRR split: 80/20 (your favor - you built substantial business)
- Referral fees: You keep 100%

**Why This Works:**
- Acknowledges investor's contribution to getting started
- Scales reward to match your growing contribution
- Investor still gets passive income stream forever
- More fair as you prove the model and do the work

---

### Option C: Equity-Based Distribution (Cleanest)

**Step 1: Determine Fair Equity Split**
- Based on capital contribution + expertise value
- Example: Investor puts in $100K + agency expertise = 30% equity
- Example: You contribute all labor + IP = 70% equity

**Step 2: Revenue Distribution**
- ALL revenue (MRR + referral fees) flows to the business
- You take operational salary ($150K-$200K/year) for running the company
- Remaining profits distributed by equity %

**Step 3: Commission Structure (On Top of Equity)**
- You get 10% commission on agencies you refer
- They get 10% commission on agencies they refer
- Incentivizes both to sell while maintaining equity fairness

**Why This Works:**
- Clear ownership structure
- Fair profit distribution aligned with equity
- Separate compensation for operational work
- Additional sales incentives
- Simplest to explain and maintain long-term

## Key Questions to Resolve

Before finalizing any revenue split structure, answer these:

### 1. Capital Contribution
- **How much capital did investor contribute?**
- Is it enough to justify 50% of MRR forever?
- What's the ROI timeline they expect?

### 2. Equity Ownership
- **What % of the company does investor own?**
- Should MRR split match equity %?
- Is there a formal equity agreement?

### 3. Ongoing Contribution
- **Will investor actively sell and refer agencies?**
- How many agencies can they realistically bring in?
- What happens if they become passive after 6 months?

### 4. Intellectual Property
- **Who owns the platform and IP?**
- Was any IP contributed by investor?
- What happens if partnership dissolves?

### 5. Work Distribution
- **Who handles customer support?**
- Who manages agency relationships?
- Who builds new features?

### 6. Exit Scenarios
- What happens if you want to buy them out?
- What happens if they want to exit?
- What's the company valuation method?

## Hidden Considerations

### The Referral Fee Leverage Point

In your proposed structure:
- Referral fees = $960K/year (from YOUR automation work)
- MRR shared = $586K/year (split with investor)

**Critical insight:** The referral fees are the bigger revenue stream AND entirely dependent on your lead generation work.

**Implications:**
- If you keep 100% of referral fees, you're capturing value you create
- But investor gets passive MRR without doing lead gen
- Is this imbalance justified by their capital/equity?

### The Scaling Problem

**Year 1:** You make $1.25M, they make $293K (4.3x ratio)

**Year 3 (10x growth):**
- You make $12.5M, they make $2.93M (4.3x ratio maintained)
- They're making $3M/year passively
- You're doing all the work

**Question:** Should their % decrease as the business scales and your contribution compounds?

### The Passive Income Risk

Investor gets:
- $293K/year passive income (50% of MRR)
- Free use of valuable tool for their agency
- No requirement to actively contribute after initial setup

You get:
- $960K from active work (lead generation)
- $293K passive (MRR share)
- All the operational burden

**Is this sustainable long-term?** What if you burn out or want to step back?

## Recommendations

### Recommended Approach: Equity-Based + Performance Incentives

1. **Establish clear equity ownership FIRST**
   - Determine based on capital + IP + sweat equity
   - Formalize in operating agreement

2. **Distribute ALL revenue by equity %**
   - No separate "I keep referrals, you keep MRR"
   - Cleaner and more standard business practice

3. **Pay yourself operational salary**
   - $150K-$200K/year for running the platform
   - Comes out before profit distribution

4. **Add performance bonuses**
   - You get 10% commission on agencies you refer
   - They get 10% commission on agencies they refer
   - Incentivizes active contribution from both

5. **Include vesting schedule**
   - Investor equity vests over 2-4 years
   - Protects you if they become passive
   - Standard in startups

6. **Build in adjustment mechanisms**
   - Review revenue split annually
   - Adjust if contribution levels change dramatically
   - Option to buy out investor if needed

## Next Steps / Action Items

- [ ] Determine exact capital contribution amount from investor
- [ ] Agree on equity ownership percentages
- [ ] Formalize equity agreement with lawyer
- [ ] Define what "active contribution" means for investor
- [ ] Set expectations for agency referrals (how many? by when?)
- [ ] Establish performance metrics for reviewing split
- [ ] Create buy-out clause and valuation method
- [ ] Document IP ownership
- [ ] Set up proper business entity (LLC/Corp)
- [ ] Get everything in writing with legal counsel

---

## Bottom Line Summary

**Your proposed structure (you keep referral fees, split MRR) works if:**
- Investor owns significant equity (40-50%) based on capital
- Investor actively contributes to sales and product
- You're compensated for operational work separately
- There's a path to adjust as contributions change

**Consider alternatives if:**
- Investor's equity is lower (<30%)
- Investor is mostly passive
- You want cleaner structure long-term
- You plan to raise additional capital later

**Most important:** Whatever you decide, get it in writing with legal counsel BEFORE the business scales. Fixing cap tables and revenue splits later is exponentially harder.

---

## Questions to Discuss with Investor

1. What % equity do you believe is fair based on your capital contribution?
2. How many agencies do you plan to refer in Year 1?
3. What does "active contribution" look like to you after the beta phase?
4. Are you comfortable with a vesting schedule for your equity?
5. What's your expected ROI timeline on your investment?
6. What happens if one of us wants to exit in 2-3 years?
7. Should we set up a formal operating agreement now?

---

**Remember:** A fair deal is one where both parties feel slightly uncomfortable - you think you're giving too much, they think they're getting too little. That's the equilibrium.

The current proposal heavily favors you in absolute dollars ($1.25M vs $293K), but potentially favors them in work-to-reward ratio if they're passive.

**Key question:** Is their capital + expertise worth $293K/year forever with minimal ongoing work? Only you can answer that based on what they bring to the table.
